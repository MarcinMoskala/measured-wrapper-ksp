# KSP Measured Wrapper Template

This is a starting point for an exercise, that is part of the [Advanced Kotlin book](https://kt.academy/book/advanced_kotlin).  The exercise is about creating a simple KSP processor that generates a wrapper class that can be used to measure the time of execution of methods from a given class.
